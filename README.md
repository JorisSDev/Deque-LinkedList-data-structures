# Deque-LinkedList-data-structures
2 programs that simulate the functionality of the Deque and LinkedList data structures in C++

These 2 programs were written as part of the data structures and algorithms course at VILNIUS TECH university.

Deque functions:

[1] :: PushBack() \n";
[2] :: PushFront() \n";
[3] :: PopFront() \n";
[4] :: PopBack() \n";
[5] :: GetFront() \n";
[6] :: GetBack() \n";
[7] :: IsEmpty() \n";
[8] :: Clear() \n";

LinkedList functions:

[0] :: exit program 
[1] :: PushBack() 
[2] :: PushFront() 
[3] :: Insert() 
[4] :: DeleteNode() 
[5] :: Search() 
[6] :: IsEmpty() 
[7] :: Size() 
[8] :: Clear()
[9] :: Reverse()
